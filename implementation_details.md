# Implementation Details: Real-time Backend Status Updates

## Context
- The backend exposes `/api/status` which returns the current backend status via the `AppStatus` singleton.
- `RagService.chat()` emits status updates via a `RagStatusListener`.
- Previously, `ChatController` passed a no-op listener, so status updates were not reflected in `AppStatus`.

## Change Summary (2025-06-06)
- `AppStatus` is now injected into `ChatController`.
- The lambda passed to `ragService.chat` now calls `appStatus.setStatus(status)`, updating the backend status on every status change during chat.
- This enables `/api/status` to reflect real-time backend processing states, improving frontend feedback and user experience.

## Backward Compatibility
- No existing functionality is removed or changed; this is an additive improvement.
- No breaking changes to API or data formats.

## Example
When a chat request is processed, the backend status will update as follows:
- "Received request"
- "Querying vector DB for raw context"
- "Calling LLM with prompt"
- etc.

Frontend polling `/api/status` will see these updates in real-time.

## Security Configuration Fix (2025-07-01)
- **Issue 1**: 403 Forbidden errors when frontend tries to access API endpoints in Cloud Foundry
- **Root Cause 1**: Spring Security was requiring authentication for all requests including API endpoints
- **Issue 2**: Blank white screen with MIME type errors for CSS/JS files
- **Root Cause 2**: Static files (`style.css`, `main.js`) were being redirected to login page instead of being served
- **Solution**: Modified `SecurityConfig.java` and `application.properties` to:
  - Permit all `/api/**` endpoints and disable CSRF for API calls
  - Allow root-level static files (`/*.css`, `/*.js`, `/*.png`, `/*.jpg`, `/*.ico`)
  - Allow actuator endpoints (`/actuator/**`) for monitoring
  - Enable health check details (`management.endpoint.health.show-details=always`)
  - Preserve existing static resource paths (`/css/**`, `/js/**`, `/images/**`)
- **Impact**: Frontend loads properly, API calls work, and monitoring endpoints are accessible
- **Code Analysis**: No authentication-dependent code exists - all controllers and services work anonymously
- **Security Note**: This is a temporary fix for development/demo purposes. For production, implement proper API authentication (JWT, API keys, etc.)

## Deployment Script (2025-07-01)
- **New Script**: Added `deploy.sh` for streamlined build and deployment workflow
- **Features**:
  - Combines Maven build (`mvn clean package`) and Cloud Foundry deployment (`cf push`)
  - Auto-detects current version from `pom.xml` and validates JAR existence
  - Validates CF CLI availability and login status
  - Provides colored output with clear status indicators
  - Supports `--skip-build` for quick redeploys
  - Supports `--app-name` for deploying to different app instances
- **Usage Examples**:
  - `./deploy.sh` - Full build and deploy
  - `./deploy.sh --skip-build` - Deploy existing JAR (faster)
  - `./deploy.sh --app-name ragui-prod` - Deploy to production instance
- **Benefits**: Simplifies the deploy process vs. manual `mvn clean package` + `cf push`

## Manifest Dynamic Path Enhancement (2025-07-09)
- **Dynamic JAR Path**: Updated deployment scripts to automatically update manifest.yml with correct JAR path
- **Features**:
  - Deployment scripts automatically update `manifest.yml` with the correct JAR path
  - Works with any version number automatically
  - Compatible with all deployment scripts (`deploy.sh`, `deploy-secure.sh`, `release.sh`)
  - No manual manifest updates required for version changes
- **Benefits**:
  - No manual manifest updates required for new versions
  - Reduces deployment friction and potential errors
  - Works seamlessly with automated release process
  - Maintains backward compatibility with existing deployment workflows
  - Handles Cloud Foundry's requirement for exact file paths

## Release Script Enhancement (2025-07-09)
- **Enhanced Build Detection**: Modified `.release-exec` to detect and use `build-secure.sh` when available
- **Features**:
  - Automatically detects `build-secure.sh` in the project root
  - Uses secure build process when available, falls back to standard Maven build
  - Maintains compatibility with existing release workflow
  - Integrates with GitHub release creation and artifact upload
- **Build Logic**:
  - If `build-secure.sh` exists: executes `./build-secure.sh`
  - If not found: uses standard `mvn clean package` with optional `-DskipTests`
  - Preserves all existing build tool detection (Maven/Gradle)
  - Maintains artifact discovery and JAR file location logic
- **Manifest Integration**: 
  - Automatically updates `manifest.yml` with correct JAR path after build
  - Works for both full releases and upload-only operations
  - Ensures manifest is always synchronized with built artifact
- **Benefits**: 
  - Seamless integration of secure credential handling in release process
  - No manual intervention required for secure builds
  - Maintains backward compatibility with standard builds
  - Automatic manifest synchronization prevents deployment issues

# RAG UI Implementation Details

## Overview
RAG UI is a Spring Boot application that provides a conversational interface for querying a vector database using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques. The system supports multiple response modes and provides both streaming and non-streaming interfaces.

## Core Components

### RagService
The main service that handles all RAG operations. Located at `src/main/java/com/baskettecase/ragui/service/RagService.java`.

#### Key Features:
- **Multiple Response Modes**: Pure LLM, RAG + LLM Fallback, RAG Only, and Raw RAG
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time response streaming with progress updates
- **Token Management**: Prevents LLM truncation through token-aware context management
- **Query Processing**: Intelligent query cleaning and expansion
- **Simple System Prompts**: Clean, direct prompts for each mode without complex filtering

#### Response Modes:

1. **Pure LLM Mode**
   - Uses only the LLM's knowledge
   - System prompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant. Answer the user's question directly and clearly using your knowledge. Always end your response with '**<span style=\"color: #007bff; font-weight: bold;\">(Pure LLM)</span>**'."

2. **RAG + LLM Fallback Mode**
   - Combines retrieved context with LLM knowledge
   - System prompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant. Use the provided context and expand on it using your vast knowledge to answer the question thoroughly with supporting information. Always end your response with '**<span style=\"color: #007bff; font-weight: bold;\">(RAG + LLM Fallback)</span>**'."

3. **RAG Only Mode**
   - Uses only retrieved context, no external knowledge
   - System prompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant. Answer the user's question using ONLY the provided context. If the context doesn't contain enough information, simply state that the information is not available in the provided context. IMPORTANT: You MUST end your response with exactly: **<span style=\"color: #007bff; font-weight: bold;\">(RAG Only)</span>**"

4. **Raw RAG Mode**
   - Returns raw retrieved documents without LLM processing
   - Used for debugging and document inspection

#### Simplified Answer Extraction:
- Removed complex filtering and reasoning pattern removal
- Simple `extractAnswer()` method that returns the LLM response as-is
- Clean, direct responses without post-processing

### Configuration

#### Token Management (application.properties):
```properties
# Token limits to prevent LLM truncation
ragui.token.max-total-tokens=8000
ragui.token.max-context-tokens=3000
ragui.token.max-response-tokens=2000
```

#### Context Management:
```properties
# Context size limits
ragui.context.max-chars=4000
ragui.context.min-doc-chars=200
```

#### Vector Search:
```properties
# Vector similarity and retrieval settings
ragui.vector.similarity-threshold=0.6
ragui.vector.top-k=5
```

### Query Processing

#### Query Cleaning:
- Uses LLM to clean and rephrase user queries
- Extracts length constraints for better responses
- Can be bypassed with `ragui.debug.skip-query-cleaning=true`

#### Query Expansion:
- Optional feature to improve retrieval
- Controlled by `QueryExpansionController.isEnabled()`

### Streaming Implementation

#### Simulated Streaming:
- Uses `simulateStreamingResponse()` for consistent UX
- Breaks responses into word-level chunks with small delays
- Provides progress updates through `RagStatusListener`

#### Progress Tracking:
- Query cleaning: 15-18%
- Vector search: 20-40%
- LLM processing: 70-90%
- Completion: 100%

### Error Handling

#### Timeout Management:
- 180-second timeout for all async operations
- Uses `CompletableFuture` with timeout executor
- Graceful error messages for timeouts

#### Exception Handling:
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Detailed logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

### Performance Optimizations

#### Token-Aware Context Management:
- Estimates tokens using character count (1 token â‰ˆ 4 characters)
- Prevents exceeding LLM token limits
- Balances context inclusion with response space

#### Async Processing:
- Non-blocking operations using `CompletableFuture`
- Shared timeout executor for resource efficiency
- Concurrent vector search and LLM calls

### Debugging Features

#### Logging:
- Detailed debug logs for vector search
- Token estimation logging
- Response mode tracking

#### Configuration Flags:
- `ragui.debug.skip-query-cleaning`: Bypass query processing
- Query expansion enable/disable
- Verbose logging controls

## Secure Credential Management (2025-01-XX)

### Overview
Default user credentials are now managed securely through a non-tracked properties file to prevent credential exposure in version control.

### Implementation:
- **Template File**: `src/main/resources/application-secure.properties.template`
- **Secure File**: `src/main/resources/application-secure.properties` (gitignored)
- **Build Scripts**: `build-secure.sh` and `deploy-secure.sh`
- **Environment Variables**: `DEFAULT_USERNAME` and `DEFAULT_PASSWORD`

### Security Features:
- Credentials are not tracked in git (added to .gitignore)
- Environment variable support for CI/CD pipelines
- Template-based approach for easy setup
- Automatic credential injection during build process

### Usage:
```bash
# Option 1: Environment variables (recommended)
export DEFAULT_USERNAME=your_username
export DEFAULT_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
./build-secure.sh

# Option 2: Manual configuration
cp src/main/resources/application-secure.properties.template src/main/resources/application-secure.properties
# Edit the file with your credentials
./build-secure.sh
```

### Build Process:
1. Checks for existing secure properties file
2. Creates from template if missing
3. Replaces placeholders with environment variables or defaults
4. Builds application with secure credentials included
5. Cleans up temporary files

### Deployment:
